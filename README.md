Its not the best, but it works. 

Please note the code comments are for me to understand what I was doing, and this is not desined to be a public project, nor does it represent my skills. I threw this together in two hours -_-

How to use:
1. run main.py in the server folder.
2. Configure ip in Client\main.py
3. The server should be running on http://localhost:8000
