Displays currently playing music from a machine.
Its not the best, but it works. 

Please note: This is just a little tinker with flask as I wanted a way to see my now playing from another device. It isn;t intended to be public, however I don't see why it wouldn't work for someone else

How to use:
1. Run main.py in the server folder. The host and port config are located at the bottom of the file
2. Configure ip in Client\main.py to match the ip and port set in the server file.
3. The server should be running on http://localhost:8000 (unless configured otherwise)
